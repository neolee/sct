# Squirrel Configuration Tool (SCT)

A native macOS GUI application for configuring the [Squirrel 鼠鬚管](https://github.com/rime/squirrel) input method, simplifying the process of customizing settings without manually editing YAML files.

This is a modern evolution of the discontinued [SCU](https://github.com/neolee/scu) project, fully rewritten in Swift and SwiftUI and facilitating AI coding agent for hopefully long term maintenance.

Documentation is *under construction*.
